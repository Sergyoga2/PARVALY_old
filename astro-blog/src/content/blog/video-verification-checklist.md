# GBP Video Verification: Checklist That Passes on the First Try

If you're going through the **Google Business Profile video verification** process, you know it's critical to get your first submission right. Waiting days—only to find your **GBP video verification failed**—can delay your ability to appear on Google Maps and get discovered by local customers.

In this guide, we’ll explain exactly **what to show in your video verification**, common reasons verifications get denied, and a simple checklist that will help ensure you pass on the first try. Whether you're a storefront or service-area business, you'll find specific tips to get your Google Business Profile verified quickly and correctly.

## Why Google Requires Video Verification

Google uses video verification to confirm that a business physically exists at the claimed location, is operational, and is owned by the person managing the GBP listing. The process is designed to reduce spam, fake listings, and policy violations.

Video verification allows Google reviewers to:

- Confirm the signage and location
- See tools or equipment relevant to your business
- Verify access to restricted areas (like staff-only sections)
- Check for consistency with your business name and category

This method helps ensure only legitimate businesses get verified on Google Maps.

## How GBP Video Verification Works

Video verification is typically required when:

- You’re creating a new Google Business Profile
- You've made significant changes to your profile (e.g., name or address)
- Your listing was suspended and is being re-verified

You’ll be prompted to capture and upload a continuous, unedited video using the Google Business Profile mobile app. The video submission walks reviewers through your physical location and proves you operate your business there.

**Important:** You must record and upload the video directly in the app. Google does not accept edited or previously recorded videos.

## Why GBP Video Verification Fails

Before we dive into the checklist, here's what commonly causes video verification failures:

- No exterior signage or visible branding
- Poor lighting or shaky video quality
- Lack of interior shots that show business activity
- Missing proof of ownership (like restricted access, employee-only areas)
- Incomplete walkthrough (skipping essential steps)
- Not showing tools, inventory, or workspaces

Google doesn’t provide detailed feedback if your video is rejected. That’s why it’s important to follow the checklist below and avoid common pitfalls.

## GBP Video Verification Checklist (Step by Step)

Use this clean checklist when preparing to film your video. Go through each point in order to maximize your chances of passing on the first try.

### 1. Start With Your Business Exterior

- Show your storefront from the street view
- Include street signs or nearby landmarks for orientation
- Clearly film your business sign with matching business name
- If you work from a suite or multi-office building, show the directory

### 2. Show Your Business Entrance

- Record yourself unlocking or opening the business door
- If access is restricted (e.g., by key or badge), show how you enter
- Business hours signage or entrance branding helps reinforce legitimacy

### 3. Film the Interior Setup

- Walk through your business space
- Show business tools (e.g., equipment, machines, inventory)
- Include staff areas or restricted zones (only if applicable)
- Demonstrate activity (a workspace in use, a job in progress)

### 4. Document Proof of Ownership or Operations

- Show yourself handling daily business tasks
- Include business licenses on the wall or displayed credentials
- Boxes with shipment labels to your business name add credibility

### 5. Show Your Branding in Multiple Ways

- Signage inside and outside
- Uniforms, brochures, and business cards
- Vehicles with branded decals (especially for service businesses)

### 6. End the Video Smoothly

- Avoid long pauses or unnecessary shots
- Be sure the video is continuous and doesn’t require editing
- Submit it directly via the Google Business Profile app

## Service-Area Businesses: Show You Work From Your Address

For **service-area businesses** (plumbers, landscapers, mobile services), it’s still important to show your tools, equipment, and branded vehicles. You may work from home or a warehouse—just make sure Google can verify that it’s your base of operations.

## Tips to Help You Succeed

These additional **video verification tips** can improve your chances:

- Film during business hours with lights on
- Use a tripod or steady hand—avoid shaky video
- Clean up your space to look professional
- Don’t rush—explain key items verbally if comfortable
- Make sure business name and category match what's shown

If your **GBP video verification failed**, correct the issue before reattempting. Repeated failures may result in escalated reviews or suspension. If that happens, our [Google Business Profile suspension guide](/blog/google-business-profile-suspension-guide/) can guide your next steps.

## What to Avoid in Your Verification Video

To stay compliant and avoid rejection, never include:

- Edited footage, cuts, or transitions
- Stock photos or logos on screens
- Third-party locations (like coworking spaces you don’t control)
- Personal conversations, customer faces, or private data

Stick to the facts: prove you operate a legitimate, clearly identified business at the location you're verifying.
