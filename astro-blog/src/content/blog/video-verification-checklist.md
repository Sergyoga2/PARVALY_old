# GBP Video Verification: Checklist That Passes on the First Try

If you're setting up or verifying your Google Business Profile (GBP), you may be asked to complete **video verification**. It’s an important step Google uses to confirm that your business exists at the stated location, offers the services claimed, and is operated by a real person.

This guide provides a clear, policy-compliant **checklist to help you pass GBP video verification on the first try**, along with answers to common questions, explanations for failed attempts, and Google-friendly best practices. Whether you're a brick-and-mortar shop, service-area business, or hybrid model, this article is written with local small business owners in mind.

## What Is Google Business Profile Video Verification?

**Google Business Profile video verification** is one of several methods Google uses to verify your business location and legitimacy. When selected for video verification, Google will prompt you to record and upload a 30–90 second video showing specific things at your business location that prove you’re physically operating there.

This method helps reduce spam listings and ensures Google Maps users can trust listed businesses.

## Why Did I Get Asked for Video Verification?

Not all profiles require video verification, but Google may choose this method when:

- Your business is newly created or has very few signals of legitimacy.
- Your profile was suspended and is now under re-verification. [Read more](blog/google-business-profile-suspension-guide/)
- You operate in a high-spam risk industry (plumbing, locksmiths, etc.).
- Your business operates in a service area without storefront signage. [Read more](blog/service-area-business-address-rules/)

If prompted, it’s essential to follow Google’s guidelines closely, or your verification attempt could be rejected.

## What to Show in a Google Business Profile Verification Video

To maximize your chance of success, your video should include these elements in one continuous shot:

### 1. **Exterior Signage and Street View**
- Start outside your business building.
- Clearly show permanent signage with your business name.
- Pan to show surrounding businesses or street signs for context.

### 2. **Business Entrance**
- Walk through your main public entrance.
- Show the door with signage, window branding, or unit number.

### 3. **Interior and Workspace**
- Enter the business and show the workspace, reception, tools, or products.
- If you’re a service-area business working from home, show active tools, branded vehicles, or stored materials.

### 4. **Proof of Business Operations**
Include items that show a real business is operating:
- Business licenses posted on walls.
- Branded packaging or uniforms.
- Equipment actively in use (e.g., grooming tables, repair machines).

### 5. **Proof of Ownership or Access**
- Verify your access to restricted areas, POS systems, workstations, etc.
- If applicable, show the business registration or access to tools only an owner/operator would have.

## Video Verification Do’s and Don’ts

### ✅ DO These:
- Film in a single, continuous take.
- Use your phone’s rear camera (not selfie).
- Record in landscape orientation, preferably.
- Ensure steady hands or use a tripod.
- Narrate briefly if helpful ("Here is our front signage...").

### ❌ DON’T Do These:
- Edit, cut, or speed up the video.
- Use stock footage, photos, or pre-recorded clips.
- Obscure your signage, paperwork, or workspace.
- Film in the dark or shaky footage.
- Use someone else’s business location or equipment.

## GBP Video Verification Failed? Here’s Why

If your **GBP video verification failed**, Google will often offer limited feedback. Some of the most common reasons include:

- ❌ Blurry or unclear footage.
- ❌ No business name shown clearly on the building or signage.
- ❌ Filming in a residential home without showing business tools or setup.
- ❌ Video didn’t include the exterior of the building.
- ❌ Incorrect business type (e.g., claiming to be a storefront when it’s a home-based service).

Before reapplying, make sure your next video addresses these failures.

## Checklist: Record a Video That Passes On The First Try

Use this foolproof checklist before you hit “Record”:

✔️ Visible exterior signage with full business name  
✔️ Front of your building or house + recognizable landmarks  
✔️ Public entrance to your location  
✔️ Clear view of interior operations (equipment, products, etc.)  
✔️ Proof of ownership or access (tools, setups, licenses)  
✔️ No editing or cuts; one continuous take  
✔️ Good lighting + legible business details  
✔️ Show the address if safe and publicly available

## How to Submit Your Verification Video

1. Open the **Google Maps app** on your smartphone.
2. Sign into the Google account tied to your GBP.
3. Access your business profile and click “Verify Now”.
4. Follow prompts to upload or record in-app.
5. Submit for review.

Most decisions are made within 3–5 business days.

## Video Verification Tips for Different Business Types

### Storefront Brick-and-Mortar Locations
- Emphasize your exterior signage, store layout, and customer-facing areas.
- Show hours signage, product shelving, payment counters.

### Service-Area Businesses
- Show branded vehicles, work tools, and licensing.
- Office or garage storage areas that support your business.

### Home-Based Businesses
- Reveal actual workspace (desk, supplies, inventory).
- Avoid just walking through a residential hallway.

## What Happens After Submission?

Once submitted, you’ll receive a confirmation message. Google will review your video and either verify your profile or reject the video with guidance to try again.

If you're rejected more than once, Google may require alternate methods, including live video calls or business documentation.
