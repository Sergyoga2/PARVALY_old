Local citations are one of the foundational elements of local SEO. They help search engines verify that your business is legitimate and that your information is accurate.

This guide covers everything you need to know about building and managing citations.

## What Are Local Citations?

A local citation is any online mention of your business that includes your:

- **Name** (business name)
- **Address** (physical location or service area)
- **Phone number**

These three elements together are known as NAP (Name, Address, Phone). Citations can also include your website URL, business hours, and other details.

## Types of Citations

### Structured Citations

Structured citations appear in business directories and listing sites where your information is entered into specific fields:

- Google Business Profile
- Yelp
- Yellow Pages
- Facebook Business
- Apple Maps
- Bing Places

### Unstructured Citations

Unstructured citations are mentions of your business in blog posts, news articles, press releases, and other content where NAP information appears within text.

## Why Citations Matter

Citations serve several important functions for local SEO:

1. **Verification**: They help Google confirm your business information is accurate
2. **Discovery**: They provide additional entry points for customers to find you
3. **Trust**: Consistent citations across many sources build trust signals
4. **Ranking**: They remain a top local ranking factor according to industry studies

## Building Your Citation Foundation

Start with the most authoritative directories and work your way down:

### Tier 1: Essential Directories

- Google Business Profile
- Apple Maps
- Bing Places for Business
- Facebook Business Page
- Yelp

### Tier 2: Major Directories

- Yellow Pages (YP.com)
- Better Business Bureau
- Foursquare
- Superpages
- Citysearch

### Tier 3: Industry-Specific

Depending on your industry, target relevant directories:

- **Home services**: HomeAdvisor, Angi, Thumbtack, Houzz
- **Healthcare**: Healthgrades, Vitals, WebMD
- **Legal**: Avvo, FindLaw, Justia
- **Restaurants**: TripAdvisor, OpenTable, Zomato

## NAP Consistency

The most critical aspect of citations is consistency. Your business information must be identical across all listings.

### Common Consistency Issues

- Abbreviations: "St." vs "Street", "Ave." vs "Avenue"
- Suite numbers: Including or excluding suite/unit numbers
- Phone format: "(555) 123-4567" vs "555-123-4567"
- Business name variations: "Bob's Plumbing" vs "Bob's Plumbing LLC"

### How to Fix Inconsistencies

1. Choose one standard format for your NAP
2. Audit all existing citations
3. Update or remove incorrect listings
4. Document your standard NAP for future reference

## Auditing Your Citations

Regular audits help you identify and fix issues:

- Search for your business name on Google
- Check major directories manually
- Use citation audit tools to find listings
- Look for duplicate listings and merge them
- Verify phone numbers are still active

## Managing Citations Over Time

Citation management is an ongoing process:

- Update all listings when you move or change phone numbers
- Remove listings for closed locations
- Monitor for duplicate or unauthorized listings
- Add new citations as new directories become relevant
- Respond to any reviews or questions on citation platforms
